## What is "Data-Structure"?

A way to store and organize data in memory in a specific structure so that it can be used efficiently.

## Need of Data Structures
As applications are getting complexed and amount of data is increasing day by day, there may arrise the following problems:

**Processor speed:** To handle very large amout of data, high speed processing is required, but as the data is growing day by day to the billions of files per entity, processor may fail to deal with that much amount of data.

**Data Search:** Consider an inventory size of 106 items in a store, If our application needs to search for a particular item, it needs to traverse 106 items every time, results in slowing down the search process.

**Multiple requests:** If thousands of users are searching the data simultaneously on a web server, then there are the chances that a very large server can be failed during that process

in order to solve the above problems, data structures are used. Data is organized to form a data structure in such a way that all items are not required to be searched and required data can be searched instantly.

## Data Structure Classification

There are two types of data structures:

### 1- Primitive Data structure

The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The ```int```, ```char```, ```float```, ```double```, and ```pointer``` are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.

### 2- Non-Primitive Data structure

The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:

**Linear Data Structures:** A data structure is called linear if all of its elements are arranged in the linear order. In linear data structures, the elements are stored in non-hierarchical way where each element has the successors and predecessors except the first and last element.

**Non Linear Data Structures:** This data structure does not form a sequence i.e. each item or element is connected with two or more other items in a non-linear arrangement. The data elements are not arranged in sequential structure.

## What is "Algorithms"?
 
- Steps to solve the problem.

- A finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code; it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudocode.
