# Intro to Algorithm Analysis

## Analysis of Algorithms

We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm: 

#### 1) Worst Case 

#### 2) Average Case 

#### 3) Best Case

## How to represent the Quality?

How much does the code take on my computer ?! we want a more general way, Hence the role of:

#### Mathematical Equations 

A relation between input size and time

We will express algorithm by a Mathematical Equations

### Mathematical Requirements: 

#### Exponentials:

##### Power

Repeated Multiplication
