# Queue

## What is a Queue?

- A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is **First In First Out (FIFO)**.
- Added element goes to back **(rear)**.
- Take the first element **(front)**.
- A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
- The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
