# Stack

## What is a Stack?

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle. It contains only one pointer pointing to the top element of the stack. Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and the element can be deleted only from the stack.
